# 📱 Google Play Store EDA

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset from the Google Play Store.  
It aims to extract meaningful insights and trends from mobile app data using Python.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This notebook analyzes various aspects of apps available on the Play Store, such as:

- Distribution of app **categories**
- Trends in **ratings**, **reviews**, and **installs**
- Comparison of **free vs paid** apps
- Insights based on **content rating**, **app size**, and **price**
- Cleaning messy data and handling duplicates/missing values

The project is built with beginner-friendly, step-by-step analysis using visuals.

## 📊 Tools and Libraries Used

The analysis is done using the following tools and libraries:

- `Python` – core programming language
- `Pandas` – for data manipulation and cleaning
- `NumPy` – for numerical operations
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` – for data visualization
- `Jupyter Notebook` – for interactive analysis

## ✅ Key Insights

Some findings from the analysis:

- **Games** and **Tools** are among the most popular categories.
- Most apps are **free**, but paid apps have slightly higher ratings.
- App **ratings cluster around 4.0 to 4.5**, with a few outliers.
- **Higher reviews** often correlate with higher **installs**, but not always.
- App size doesn't have a strong correlation with installs or ratings.
